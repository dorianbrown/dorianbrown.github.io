Following up on my first article, I realized this week that I forgot to add a category. One of the things I really enjoyed about creating dashboards at my first job was working with very low-level javascript frameworks to create visualizations.

There are a lot of cool things you can do with these javascript frameworks. For a quick impression of whats possible, check out some of these examples from some of the ones I checked out:
<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/">Paper.js</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://soulwire.github.io/sketch.js/">Sketch.js</a></li>
 	<li><a href="http://processingjs.org/exhibition/">processing.js</a></li>
</ul>

I decided to choose <a href="http://paperjs.org/">paper.js</a> for the kinds of projects I wanted to do, since it has really nice <a href="http://paperjs.org/tutorials/">tutorials</a>, <a href="http://paperjs.org/reference/global/">documentation </a>and lots of <a href="http://paperjs.org/examples/">examples</a>. It also makes use of some nice high-level abstractions to make creating stuff easier.

For my first project I wanted to try out something really simple, to test out how to work with the library, and to have some fun.

This is just a few hours of messing around, but there are a lot more projects in the pipeline!
