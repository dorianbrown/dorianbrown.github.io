My name is Dorian Brown, I'm half Dutch half American, and I've been living in the Netherlands near Amsterdam (*Leiden!*) since 2002. I have an MSc in Theoretical Mathematics from Leiden University and am currently working as a data scientist at ING in the Netherlands.

I started this blog as a creative outlet and reason to work on new ideas. In my current job I get to apply many different machine-learning techniques and teach them to fellow data scientists, and as I enjoy writing I thought this would be a great way to practice both of these skills for a wider audience. For more on this blog you can check out [my first post]({% post_url 2017-10-08-a-short-introduction-and-what-this-blog-is-going-to-be-about %}).

## The Future

Although currently employed, I'm looking out for a new application of machine learning to eventually start my own company. I sometimes feel that with the technologies currently available, our creativity is the largest constraint in finding business opportunities and ways of making life better.

I also love building tangible products, which people can interact with. I love that Spotify's Radio has introduced me to all kinds of music I never would have listened to otherwise, and it's almost entirely machine learning. I hope to one day create a start-up which offers some kind of service with machine-learning at it's core, to improve people's life in some concrete way.
